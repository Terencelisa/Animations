    <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
    <p class="enchantress">
        The author uses the pseudo name or the pen name of Neha Sharma to pen down her thoughts. She is from Mumbai and she believes that people, outside as well as inside India are very ignorant about the Indian culture. That is why, she has decided to write
        books which show her culture, good and the bad and the possible reasons in her own way. She strives to educate everyone on the Indian culture through the bookish media the way people understand the American culture through the movie media.
